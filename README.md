Data Structure Visualizer

# Inspiration

## Teaching 
While I was teaching my friends about competitive programming in high school, I always had to use other means to illustrate
the abstract ideas of a data strucutre. Albeit many were more abstract and harder to visualize, I personally found it to be 
greatly effective for me to learn with a much more visual stimuli. 

## Personal growth
As a competitive programmer, it is vital that the data structures and algorithms are memorized and thoroughly understood that 
they can be quickly implemented. Especially with graphs and abstract data structures. 

# Data structures 

## Trees
- [x] AVL Tree
- [x] Binary Search Tree
- [x] Segment Tree (With lazy propagation)
- [x] Binary Indexed Trees
- [ ] Treap

## Graph Algorithms
- [x] SPFA, Dijkstra's Algorithm
- [x] Path finding 
- [x] Lowest Common Ancestor 
- [x] Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm
- [ ] Heavy Light Decomposition 
- [ ] Tarjan's Algorithm

## Dynamic Programming (DP)
- [x] Knap Sack DP
- [ ] Bitwise DP

## Other useful algorithms
- [x] Binary Search
- [x] Fast Exponentiation
